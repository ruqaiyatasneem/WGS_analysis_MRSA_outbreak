# WGS_analysis_MRSA_outbreak
The data had been taken from the paper- Whole-genome sequencing for analysis of an outbreak of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a descriptive study, Harris et al.
Snippy pipeline has been used for finding the variants in ST2371 isolates and ST22 is used as reference.

Since the tools used are different from the original paper, the results vary for some isolates whereas remain the same for the rest.

The dendrogram and phylogenetic tree was constructed based on SNP dist matrix

Will Upload data from other pipelines soon :)
